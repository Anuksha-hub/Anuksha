\section{Introduction}
Cloud computing sets the giant stride for a new era of
computing globally ~\cite{1}. Cloud computing actually changes the
way and manner applications are developed and maintain as
well as the processes in which infrastructure are run by users.
Cloud computing, also known as on-demand computing, is a
kind of internet-based computing, where shared resources and
information are provided to computers and other devices on demand. It is a model for enabling ubiquitous, on-demand
access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources
~\cite{2}. Cloud computing and storage solutions provide users and
enterprises with various capabilities to store and process their
data in third-party data centers. It relies on sharing of resources
to achieve coherence and economies of scale, similar to a
utility (like the electricity grid) over a network. At the
foundation of cloud computing is the broader concept of
converged infrastructure and shared services. The “Cloud” in
simpler term also focuses on maximizing the effectiveness of
the shared resources. Cloud resources are usually not only
shared by multiple users but are also dynamically reallocated
per demand; this can work for allocating resources to users.
This approach helps maximize the use of computing power
while reducing the overall cost of resources by using less
power, air conditioning, rack space, etc. to maintain the
system. With cloud computing, multiple users can access a
single server to retrieve and update their data without
purchasing licenses for different applications. Cloud
Computing permits the usage of information technology on the
basis of effective functionalities on-demand by users. The
cloud technology offers lots of possibilities to businesses and
organization having an inadequate capital, lack of human
resources, and also lack access to marketing network.
The rapid development of cloud technology indicates certainly
non reduction in terms of acceptance and frequent utilization
from different sectors by emerging countries like India,
Singapore, America and others. According to 2016 BSA
Global Cloud Computing Scorecard, estimates that by 2019
global market will exceed US\$130 billion, The Scorecard
positions the “IT infrastructure and policy environment — or
cloud computing readiness — of 24 countries that account for
80 per cent of the world’s IT markets”, that Cloud computing
as a current IT invention, has further supplement innovative
measurement to that significance by increasing access to
technology that pushes for economic growth generally at all
levels.
But upon all these underlying possibilities the cloud
technology brought into businesses in emerging countries a lot
of challenges were faced that results to low implementation
and will be discussed and recommend ways so as to improve
the level of implementing the technology.

\section{Literature Review}
Cloud computing evolved from several technologies and
business approaches that emerged over the years ~\cite{3} the basic
concept of Cloud Computing is separating the application from
the operating system as well as the hardware its self. This
processes of separation brought about the underlying
technology of cloud computing called Virtualization.
Emerging Trends in Big Data, IoT and Cyber Security
ISBN: 978-93-86238-93-1 8
Virtualization plays a vital role in cloud computing processes
~\cite{4}. It is a method of installing and organizing computing
resources. It separates the different levels of the application
system comprising the hardware, software, data, networking,
storage etc. It also breakdowns the division between the data
centre, servers, storage, networking, data and the physical
devices, by recognizing dynamic architecture, then attains the
goals of organizing centralized and making use of dynamically
the physical resources and virtual resources, improving the
flexibility of the system, reducing the cost, improving the
service and decreasing the risk of management. Cloud
computing acceptances generally are attractive in planning
businesses for more profitability, success and cost
management. Most emerging Countries are not an exception
their role in the service provision sector thereby making some
giant strives and increasing their efforts to create more
awareness and contribute substantially in helping companies
migrate to the cloud emphasized that the cloud technology
saves costs for servers and storage, offers speed in processes
and streamlines application deployment without upfront
capital, that is why many organizations are now considering
acceptance of cloud computing to provide more efficient and
cost effective network services while other are afraid of the
challenges. For those countries to overcome the challenges that
lead to low acceptance some obstacles need to be addressed.
However, it is no coincidence that business executives in
emerging countries have developed a limitless desire for
technology in order to drive and transform their businesses.
~\cite{5}Business and technology are inseparable that makes it
difficult to determine which one can work without one where
profit maximization (revenue increase / cost reduction) is an
essential performance indicator upon which business successes
are measured.
\section{Public Cloud}  
A public cloud environment is maintained by an  outsourced  cloud  provider  and  is  reachable  to many businesses through  the internet  on a  pay-per-use model. This distribution model provides services and  organization  to  businesses  who  want  to  save money  on  IT  operational  costs,  but  it’s  the  cloud provider  who  is  responsible  for  the  invention  and safeguarding of the resources. Public clouds are model aimed at minor with average  magnitude  businesses  with  a  constricted budget requiring a quick and easy platform in which to deploy IT resources. Merits of a public cloud Easy scalability No geographical restrictions Cost effective Highly reliable Easy to manage Demerits of a public is Not examine the safest option for sensitive data  \section{Private Cloud}  
This  cloud  distribution model is   modified infrastructure  maintained  by  a  single  business.  It offers a precise environment in  which contact to IT resources  is  additionally  centralized  within  the business.  The  present  exemplary  perhaps  visibly introduced  either  obtainable handled internal. Even though  secluded  cloud  introducing  obtainable valuable,  as largest  productions it could  be action a developed  equal of  safety  and  extra  self-sufficiency to  modify  the  storing,  interacting  and  calculate mechanisms toward ensemble their IT necessities.
\section{Cloud Services}
 Following  are  three  foremost  service  models  of cloud computing —  Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) Platform as a Provision (PaaS)  Program as a Provision  There are pure changes among the three and what they  can suggestion a occupational  in rapports of  storing  and  basis  combining,  then  they  can  too cooperate through individually additional method  of wide-ranging prototypical of cloud computing.
